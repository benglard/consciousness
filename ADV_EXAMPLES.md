# Adversarial Examples and Wormholes

In studying aspects of black hole information theory, Maldacena and Susskind introduced the hypothesis that `ER = EPR`. ER represented Einstein-Rosen bridges or wormholes. EPR represented Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen or entanglement. The 'equality' suggested that wormholes, or generally spacetime geometry, emerges from entanglement.

Adversarial examples in ML bear some resemblance to wormholes: small pertubations can transport you from one part of latent space to another. During training SGD constructs a latent space by breaking down and discovering structural features. Perhaps collections of features which become over entangled cause the development of adversarial wormholes.
