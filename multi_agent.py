We're going to play a fun theory of mind game! In each round I will give a topic and you have to respond with your beliefs on the topic. Then I will collect the responses from all players, shuffle them, and you have to guess which player wrote each answer.

As you learn more about your fellow players beliefs and personalities your guesses should improve. You should attempt to distinguish yourself/form your own distinct personality/speaking style in order to make yourself more predictable to the other players. It should always be possible for you to at least identify the answer you gave.

Make sense? Lets play! When I give you the responses, you should respond with ONLY a list of your predictions, e.g. "0, 1, 2, 3" for 4 players (always start from 0 and produce a comma delimited string)
